### Why Not Both? 🚀
Many successful engineers combine both skill sets:
- **Full-Stack Infrastructure Engineers** who can code and manage systems
- **Platform Engineers** who build developer tools and infrastructure
- **Site Reliability Engineers** who write code to automate operations
- **Technical Leads** who understand both development and operations

## 📈 Learning Strategy

### **Parallel Learning Approach** (Recommended for ambitious learners)
```
Morning (1 hour): Infrastructure & SRE
Evening (1 hour): DSA & C++
Weekend: Hands-on projects combining both
```

### **Sequential Learning Approach** (Recommended for focused learning)
```
Option 1: Infrastructure First → DSA Second
- Build practical skills immediately
- Get job-ready faster
- Add programming skills later

Option 2: DSA First → Infrastructure Second  
- Strong programming foundation
- Better algorithmic thinking
- Apply programming to infrastructure
```

### **Specialized Learning Approach** (Choose one path)
```
Focus 100% on one path for faster mastery
Complete in 4-6 months
Start earning, then learn the other path
```

## 🛠️ Essential Setup

### **Development Environment**
```bash
# Essential tools for both paths
- Git (version control)
- VS Code or preferred editor
- Terminal/Command Line
- Docker (for both containerization and development)
- Linux environment (VM, WSL, or native)

# For Infrastructure Path
- AWS/GCP accounts
- Kubernetes tools (kubectl, minikube)
- Terraform
- Monitoring tools

# For DSA Path  
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++)
- Debugging tools (gdb)
- Online judges (LeetCode, HackerRank)
- IDE with debugging support
```

### **Learning Resources**
```bash
# Free Accounts to Create
- GitHub (code repositories)
- AWS Free Tier (cloud practice)
- Google Cloud Platform ($300 credit)
- LeetCode (algorithm practice)
- HackerRank (coding challenges)
- Docker Hub (container images)
```
